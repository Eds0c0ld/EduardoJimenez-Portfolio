Summary:
For this project, I created a program called Corner Grocer that reads item data from a text file and keeps track of how many times each item appears. 
The goal was to help a small grocery store analyze shopping trends by showing which items customers buy most often. The program outputs the data in a 
clean format, including a histogram that makes it easy to see which items are most popular.

What I did well:
I think I did a good job organizing the code and keeping it easy to read. I used functions to separate the logic and added comments to make it clear what 
each part does. The way the program handles input and output from files worked really well, and I’m proud of how I got it to read and display the data accurately.

Areas for improvement:
If I were to improve it, I’d focus on adding more input validation and better error handling in case the file is missing or formatted wrong. 
I’d also look for ways to make the code more efficient by optimizing loops and reducing repetition. Those changes would make the program stronger and more reliable overall.

Challenges and problem-solving:
The hardest part was figuring out why my file reading wasn’t working correctly at first. I used print statements to test small parts of 
the program until I found what was causing the issue. Debugging step by step helped a lot. I also looked back at my Codio labs and examples to 
remind myself how file streams work in C++.

Transferable skills:
This project helped me build confidence using C++, especially with loops, functions, and data handling. It also taught me the importance of testing 
and debugging, which I know will carry over into other programming languages and projects I work on later.

Maintainability and readability:
To keep the code clean, I used descriptive variable names, consistent formatting, and detailed comments. The program is easy to understand and 
update, which makes it maintainable for future use or improvements.
